<h1>Ayt Xebbac</h1>
<p>The Ayt Xebbac, living along the Moroccan-Algerian border at the northwestern edge of the Sahara, have an extensive traditional knowledge of astronomy, passed down in Tamazight (Berber). This sky culture file summarizes what could be gleaned of this in the course of a trip primarily focused on other issues.
